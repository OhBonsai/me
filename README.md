# ME

## Paper Work
```
You good, Friend
From a idea  
Give shape
Let it morph
Eyes on horizon
Follow the trend
Keep trying
Keep curiosity
Keep learning
Endure loneliness
Keep patient
In solitude. be a multitude
A Small character has unrivaled power
A Small change can create difference
A Small ego maybe touch  the same small you 
Thanks for watching
```
